EventSub Client
---------------

EventSub lets you listen for events that happen on Twitch.

The EventSub client runs in its own thread, calling the given callback function whenever an event happens.

Look at the `Twitch EventSub reference <https://dev.twitch.tv/docs/eventsub/eventsub-reference>`__ to find the topics
you are interested in.

************
Requirements
************

.. note:: Please note that Your Endpoint URL has to be HTTPS, has to run on Port 443 and requires a valid, non self signed certificate
            This most likely means, that you need a reverse proxy like nginx. You can also hand in a valid ssl context to be used in the constructor.

In the case that you don't hand in a valid ssl context to the constructor, you can specify any port you want in the constructor and handle the
bridge between this program and your public URL on port 443 via reverse proxy.\n
You can check on whether or not your webhook is publicly reachable by navigating to the URL set in `callback_url`.
You should get a 200 response with the text `pyTwitchAPI eventsub`.

*******************
Listening to topics
*******************

After you started your EventSub client, you can use the :code:`listen_` prefixed functions to listen to the topics you are interested in.

The function you hand in as callback will be called whenever that event happens with the event data as a parameter.

************
Code Example
************

.. code-block:: python

    from twitchAPI.twitch import Twitch
    from twitchAPI.helper import first
    from twitchAPI.eventsub import EventSub
    from twitchAPI.oauth import UserAuthenticator
    from twitchAPI.types import AuthScope
    import asyncio

    TARGET_USERNAME = 'target_username_here'
    EVENTSUB_URL = 'https://url.to.your.webhook.com'
    APP_ID = 'your_app_id'
    APP_SECRET = 'your_app_secret'
    TARGET_SCOPES = [AuthScope.MODERATOR_READ_FOLLOWERS]


    async def on_follow(data: dict):
        # our event happend, lets do things with the data we got!
        print(data)


    async def eventsub_example():
        # create the api instance and get the ID of the target user
        twitch = await Twitch(APP_ID, APP_SECRET)
        user = await first(twitch.get_users(logins=TARGET_USERNAME))

        # the user has to authenticate once using the bot with our intended scope.
        # since we do not need the resulting token after this authentication, we just discard the result we get from authenticate()
        # Please read up the UserAuthenticator documentation to get a full view of how this process works
        auth = UserAuthenticator(twitch, TARGET_SCOPES)
        await auth.authenticate()

        # basic setup, will run on port 8080 and a reverse proxy takes care of the https and certificate
        event_sub = EventSub(EVENTSUB_URL, APP_ID, 8080, twitch)

        # unsubscribe from all old events that might still be there
        # this will ensure we have a clean slate
        await event_sub.unsubscribe_all()
        # start the eventsub client
        event_sub.start()
        # subscribing to the desired eventsub hook for our user
        # the given function (in this example on_follow) will be called every time this event is triggered
        # the broadcaster is a moderator in their own channel by default so specifying both as the same works in this example
        await event_sub.listen_channel_follow_v2(user.id, user.id, on_follow)

        # eventsub will run in its own process
        # so lets just wait for user input before shutting it all down again
        try:
            input('press Enter to shut down...')
        finally:
            # stopping both eventsub as well as gracefully closing the connection to the API
            await event_sub.stop()
            await twitch.close()
        print('done')


    # lets run our example
    asyncio.run(eventsub_example())
